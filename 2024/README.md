This part contains solutions in Python next to solutions in Julia.

The Python-ones were created before the Julia ones, so they latter
benefitted from some knowledge about a good solution of the problems.

Some Python solutions are missing. Those are solutions which I am totally
not happy with yet. Will go over the code in time.

For an alternative to the Julia-solutions please see
https://github.com/Fexilus/advent-of-code-2024-julia-solutions/tree/main/src
I find those solutions often a bit too verbose and convoluted for my taste,
but useful for a second look and inspiration, should one be stuck.
